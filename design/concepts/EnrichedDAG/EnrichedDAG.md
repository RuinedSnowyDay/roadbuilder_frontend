# Concept: EnrichedDAG

+ **concept** EnrichedDAG[Object, User]
+ **purpose** Model and manage hierarchical relationships or dependencies between
  entities while ensuring the integrity of a non-circular structure
+ **principle** Users can create new graph, add nodes to the graph or remove them, add
  edges between nodes in the graph or remove them. Nodes have titles associated with
  them; they are unique to one particular graph and can be changed by the user.  All
  added nodes and edges should have some "enrichment" object associated with them.
  User can't add edges so that they form a cycle in the graph.
+ **state**
  + A set of Graphs with
    + an owner User
    + a title String
  + A set of Nodes with
    + a parent Graph
    + a title String
    + an enrichment Object
  + A set of Edges with
    + a source Node
    + a target Node
    + an enrichment Object
+ **actions**
  + createEmptyGraph(owner: User, graphTitle: String): (newGraph: Graph)
    + **requires** there are no Graphs with the same owner User and graphTitle String
     in the set of Graphs
    + **effects** adds new Graph with provided owner User and graphTitle String to the
      set of Graphs
  + accessGraph(owner: User, graphTitle: String): (accessedGraph: Graph)
    + **requires** there is a Graph with owner as an owner User and graphTitle as a
      title String in the set of Graphs
    + **effects** returns the Graph that has owner as an owner User and graphTitle as a
      title String
  + addNode(graph: Graph, nodeTitle: String, enrichment: Object): (newNode: Node)
    + **requires** graph is in the set of Graphs. There are no Nodes with the same
      parent Graph and title String in the set of Nodes
    + **effects** and a new Node with provided parent Graph, nodeTitle title and
      enrichment Object to the set of Nodes. Returns the new Node.
  + accessNode(graph: Graph, nodeTitle: String): (accessedNode: Node)
    + **requires** graph is in the set of Graphs. There is a Node associated with
      graph as a parent Graph and nodeTitle as a title String in the set of Nodes
    + **effects** returns the Node that has graph as a parent Graph and nodeTitle as a
      title String
  + changeNodeTitle(graph: Graph, node: Node, newNodeTitle: string)
    + **requires** graph is in the set of Graphs, node is in the set of Nodes, node's
      parent Graph is graph. There are no Nodes with graph as a parent Graph and
      newNodeTitle as a title String in the set of Nodes.
    + **effects** changes the title of the node to newNodeTitle
  + addEdge(graph: Graph, sourceNode: Node, targetNode: Node, enrichment: Object):
    (newEdge: Edge)
    + **requires** graph in the set of Graphs, sourceNode and targetNode are in the
      set of Nodes, sourceNode's parent Graph is graph, targetNode's parent Graph is
      graph. There are no Edges that have sourceNode as a source Node and targetNode
      as a target Node.  Adding the edge shouldn't create cycles in the graph
    + **effects** adds a new Edge with sourceNode as a source Node, targetNode as a
      target Node, and enrichment Object as an enrichment to the set of Edges, and
      returns this new Edge.
  + accessEdge(graph: Graph, sourceNode: Node, targetNode: Node): (newEdge: Edge)
    + **requires** graph is in the set of Graphs. Both sourceNode and targetNode are
      in the set of Nodes. Both sourceNode and targetNode have graph as a parent
      Graph.  There is an edge with sourceNode as a source Node and targetNode as a
      target node in the set of Edges
    + **effects** returns the Edge in the graph that has sourceNode as a source Node
      and tagetNode as a target Node.
  + removeNode(node: Node)
    + **requires** node is in the set of Nodes
    + **effects** removes node from the set of Nodes. Also removes all edges that
      have node as either a source or a target.
  + removeEdge(edge: Edge)
    + **requires** edge is in the set of Edges
    + **effects** removes edge from the set of Edges
  + deleteGraph(graph: Graph)
    + **requires** graph is in the set of Graphs
    + **effects** removes all nodes that have graph as a parent Graph from the set of
      Nodes. Removes all edges associated with removed nodes (done automatically
      through removeNode action). Removes graph from the set of Graphs.
  + *async* suggestNodeTitle(graph: Graph): (suggestedNodeTitle: String)
    + **requires** graph is in the set of Graphs
    + **effects** returns a suggestion for the title of a new node using ✨AI✨.
      Suggestion is based on the graph's title, titles of nodes associated with
      this graph, and edges in the graph.
  + *async* suggestEdge(graph: Graph): (suggestedSourceNode: Node,
    suggestedTargetNode: Node, reasonable: bool)
    + **requires** graph is in the set of Graphs
    + **effects** returns a suggestion for a new edge using ✨AI✨. Suggestion is based
      on the graph's title, titles of nodes associated with this graph, and edges in
      the graph, and is provided as a three-element output containing suggested source
      and target Nodes, as well as *reasonable* flag, which indicates, whether the model
      considers its suggestion as reasonable or not, since it may be possible that there
      are no good suggestions for edges in the graph.
+ Invariants
  + There are no cycles in the graph.
  + There are no nodes with the same title in one graph
  + There are no edges between nodes in different graphs
